After installing files, make a folder called project
Copy all the files in the folder.
Open the folder in VS CODE (or any IDE/text editor you prefer).
From the terminal run the following command from your parent/root directory (project folder):
  npm install
This will install all dependencies and you'll see node_modules folder being created.
From the root directory run the following command inside the terminal:
  node server
this will get your server running and you'll see a message "server running on port ..."
Use any API testing service to see the Library management backend in action.
